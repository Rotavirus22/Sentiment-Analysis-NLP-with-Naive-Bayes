# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis** model using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm on the **IMDB dataset** of 50K movie reviews. The model classifies movie reviews as either **positive** or **negative** based on the sentiment expressed in the review text.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the text data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into a numerical format using the **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** model.
3. **Model Training**: Train a **Naive Bayes** classifier to predict the sentiment (positive or negative).
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using **Flask** and provide an API endpoint for predictions.
